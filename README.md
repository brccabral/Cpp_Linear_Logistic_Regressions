Followed videos from **AI Coding** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKtbNvCT8Dc&list=PLNpKaH98va-FJ1YN8oyMQWnR1pKzPu-GI

### Eigen lib
Eigen is a library to help matrix operations.
Need to use v3.2.
Eigen library downloaded from https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page  
These are just header files.

### Wine dataset
Wine dataset `wine.data` downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine  
The larger dataset `winedata.csv` was downloaded from **AI Coding** repository.
To use **AI Coding** Normalize() function we need to remove a few recods from the larger dataset. If you want to keep all records, use the Eigen's own norm() function.
